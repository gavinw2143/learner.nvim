Hey ho

I want to track my learning!
- Through a Neovim plugin: learner.nvim
- Check out and potentially make use of OpenRouter

## learner.nvim
1. My knowledge should be stored as such:
- Topics should havep riority based on:
. Some spaced repetition algorithm
. Current tasks andp lans

2. Learning tasks should be tracked and scheduled, pertaining to a larger goal requiring the skills learned through the tasks
- LLM call to assess the user's goals, and suggest methods to approach them and learning the skills required to accomplish them

? Use Neo4j graph DB queries to track and retrieve my knowledge

Could you ask questions about this endeavor to ensure it is implemented with as much nuance as possible?

To make sure **learner.nvim** ends up as flexible, powerful, and tailored to your workflows, I’d love to dig into some details across its major components:

---

### 1. Data Model & Graph Structure

1. **Topic definition**

   * What minimal metadata do you want each “Topic” node to carry? (e.g. title, description, difficulty, estimated time)
2. **Relationships**

   * Which kinds of edges do you envision? (e.g. *prerequisite*, *depends-on*, *related*)
3. **Granularity**

   * Will a “Topic” ever map 1:1 to a flashcard, or do you want separate “Card” nodes under a Topic?
4. **Versioning / Evolution**

   * How should edits to topics (or their relationships) be tracked over time?

---

### 2. Spaced-Repetition & Prioritization

1. **Algorithm choice**

   * Are you thinking of SM‐2 (Anki), Leitner boxes, or something custom?
2. **Input signals**

   * Besides “last reviewed” and “ease factor,” how should current active tasks or deadlines boost a topic’s queue priority?
3. **Decay / reprioritization**

   * Should priorities automatically decay if you neglect a topic for X days, or only update on review?

---

### 3. Task ↔ Goal Management

1. **Goal declaration**

   * How will the user declare a “larger goal”? (e.g. via a command, YAML in a project file, or natural‐language prompt)
2. **Task linking**

   * Should each learning task be explicitly tied to one goal, or can tasks roll up into multiple overlapping goals?
3. **Progress metrics**

   * What does “done” look like? Passing a quiz? Completing a mini‐project?
4. **Scheduling**

   * Do you want in‐Neovim pop‐up reminders, integration with an external scheduler, or both?

---

### 4. LLM Integration (via OpenRouter)

1. **Prompt sourcing**

   * When you ask the plugin “assess my goals,” will it pull in your entire topic graph, recent commits, or just the goal text?
2. **Trigger points**

   * Do you want on-demand analysis (`:LearnerSuggest`) or periodic “check-ins”?
3. **Customization**

   * What parameters should be user-configurable? (model name, temperature, system prompt templates)

---

### 5. Neo4j Connectivity

1. **Local vs remote**

   * Will you run Neo4j locally, in Docker, or connect to a hosted instance?
2. **Authentication & secrets**

   * How do you want to supply connection strings and credentials? Env-vars, `.env`, Neovim’s secret store?
3. **Query APIs**

   * Do you prefer raw Cypher in Lua or a thin query-builder layer?
4. **Offline fallback**

   * If DB is unreachable, should learner.nvim degrade gracefully to a flat file cache?

---

### 6. UI/UX in Neovim

1. **Navigation**

   * Floating windows? A split panel with a graph view? Telescope pickers for topics/tasks?
2. **Commands & keymaps**

   * Which core commands do you need at minimum? (e.g. `:LearnerAdd`, `:LearnerReview`, `:LearnerGraph`)
3. **Visualization**

   * Would ASCII-based dependency trees suffice, or do you want integration with external graph renderers?

---

### 7. Extensibility & Workflow Integration

1. **Existing notes**

   * Do you want to pull in Markdown/Org headings as pre-seeded topics?
2. **Version control**

   * Should topic changes be Git-tracked automatically, or is that left to the user?
3. **Plugin interoperability**

   * Any other Neovim plugins you’d like learner.nvim to hook into? (e.g. `neorg`, `telescope`, `nvim-tree`)

---

Feel free to pick the areas you’d like to flesh out first, or suggest others I haven’t thought to ask about!

1.
    * Each "Topic" node should have a depth-of-knowledge rating. This should be produced through evaluation of previous
    stored responses from the user relating to the primary topic. 
    * Adjacent "prerequisite" topics relevant to understanding a primary topic of interest should be evaluated for assumed understanding.
    * Topics should have a "description" in the form of Topic node relations, where each relation corresponds to a detailed description of how they relate
    * Topics should be explored based on user interest, so this would likely be important to include as a metric
    * I would like to represent the topics as tokens (vectors), and be able to group them in either meaningful sequence or a set. I envision this representing the "title" of topics, but this may be beyond scope at the moment. Naively, we can likely just leverage:
    1. Topic text
    2. Context: labels that clarify the interpretation of the text
    3. Perspective: described role to frame aspects of focus on the topic
    * "Prerequisite" and "depends-on" encapsulate similar ideas, so I'd like to try having "prerequisite" relations with description of how they relate
    * Topics will never map to flashcards
    * For versioning, encode a description of the knowledgebase as a Git-like tree structure, and store updates as a sequence of detailed CRUD actions performed with timestamps to construct the knowledgebase

2.
    * I was thinking FSRS, but may want to add other algorithm choices as options
    * I was thinking topics of greater user interest, which may incorporate active tasks into evaluation, would be holistically evaluated with FSRS to form a priority score. But I lack a great understanding of how FSRS works, means to do this, etc.

3. 
    * The user's goals will be stored through LLM evaluation of the conversationbase
* The conversationbase will contain all interactions between the user and learner.nvim

## learner.nvim:
    * A tool for graceful thought:
1. A keymap can open a menu/hub where a user can access their queries to learner.nvim, make new queries to learner.nvim, and set options for learner.nvim
    2. VISUAL-mode-highlighted text + a hotkey will open a small window under the cursor that allows the user to make some query regarding the highlighted text
    3. Each query has a context and related topics
4. User can configure topic focus manually by requesting learner.nvim

I decided to name this plugin learner.nvim; the ideas I already described depend on it

    * Tasks can and should roll up into multiple overlapping goals
    * "Done" looks exactly as you describe: completing assessments through conversation and evaluating documents/codebases that determine ability to build projects, complete assignments
    * Let's focus away from scheduling for now: maybe implement later. I do want to integrate ability for the user to observe their topics of focus, make changes, and enhance their understanding through LLM-guided assessment

4.
    * The plugin will always be assessing the user's goals through evaluation of previous conversations (conversationbase)
    * The "chain of focus" describes a set of text segments of the conversationbase, which characterizes a user's motivations and objectives. On-demand analysis should occur after every interaction: the chain of focus should shift according to how goals either shift towards different topics or are achieved. Observability will be important here
    * User should be able to configure prompt type: 
    1. Elaborate
    2. Summarize
    3. Find analogies -- Only on multiple text segments
    * And configure a set/sequence of text segments to a single prompt of any type
    * User should be able to configure the model type for each prompt: include a user-configurable default

5.
    * I'd like to try using Dagger.io containers
    * I don't have much experience with managing credentials and authentication properly, so just propose something robust
    * A thin query-builder layer would suit this project best
    * Degrading to a flat file cache should work well

6. 
    * Some clarifications relevant to describing UI occur earlier in this response: I also have a basic UI plugin already written that allows management of conversations stored in a JSON file on-disk: this can be used as a base
    * Integration with external graph renderers is preferable, but ASCII-based dependency trees can suffice for a proof-of-concept

7.
    * Given everything stated above, give me some suggestions on what you think would work best for extensibility and workflow integration

Keep asking questions! I want this to be very robust and managable; if you have concerns be sure to express them.

Here are some thoughts on making **learner.nvim** as extensible and seamlessly integrated into your workflow as possible—plus a few more questions to nail down the details:

---

## Suggestions for Extensibility & Workflow Integration

### 1. Modular Architecture

* **Core “Graph Engine”**

  * Encapsulate all Neo4j interactions behind a Lua module with a simple query-builder API (e.g. `graph:create_topic(…)`, `graph:update_edge(…)`).
  * Allow swapping Neo4j for a flat-file adapter by conforming to the same interface.
* **FSRS & Prioritization Layer**

  * Isolate FSRS-specific code in its own module so that additional algorithms (e.g. Leitner, custom heuristics) can be dropped in by implementing a single function signature (`score(topic)`).
* **LLM Integration Layer**

  * Wrap all calls to OpenRouter behind a `learner.llm.request(prompt_type, context_segments, opts)` API—so you can swap providers or add caching/retries without touching your UI code.
* **UI Layer**

  * Define a minimal set of “events” (e.g. `on_topic_selected`, `on_review_complete`, `on_query_submitted`) that UI components can subscribe to.
  * Ship a default Telescope picker + floating-window dashboard, but allow third-party plugins to register their own UIs by listening for those events.

### 2. Configuration & Secrets

* Store credentials (Neo4j URI, OpenRouter API key) in a single `learner.setup({ … })` call, loading defaults from environment or a `.env` file under `stdpath("config")`.
* Offer an override hook—so users can plug in [vim-secret](https://github.com/kdheepak/vim-secret) or similar if they want encrypted storage later.

### 3. Data Versioning

* Treat your Git-style tree as a pluggable backend:

  * Default: log CRUD actions to a JSON “action log,” then expose a `:LearnerUndo` / `:LearnerRedo` that replays or rolls back the log.
  * Advanced: integrate with `git` under the hood—automatically commit snapshot files as topics evolve.

### 4. Containerized Development with Dagger.io

* Provide a `:LearnerDevStart` command that spins up a Dagger container with Neo4j preconfigured, then points your plugin at that instance.
* Let power-users pass in a `docker-compose.yml` or Dagger script to customize the environment.

### 5. Conversationbase & Chain-of-Focus

* Store each LLM query + response as a node (or property) in the graph, tagged with timestamp and topic affinities.
* Maintain a “focus pointer” that updates on each edit or query—expose it via a Telescope picker so you can jump back to any point in your study timeline.

### 6. Integration Points

* **Notes Import**: Write a small adapter to scrape Markdown/Org headings (e.g. `## Monad` → `Topic: Monad`) so you can bootstrap your graph from existing notes.
* **Neorg / Orgmode**: Offer a Pandoc-style exporter that syncs Org headings → graph, letting you maintain your master outline in Org while tracking metadata in Neo4j.
* **Telescope**:

  * `:Telescope learner topics`
  * `:Telescope learner tasks`
  * `:Telescope learner focus_history`

---

## Follow-Up Questions

1. **Depth-of-Knowledge & FSRS**

   * How granular do you want your “previous stored responses” to be? Whole conversation chunks, single-sentence answers, or something in between?
   * Would you like to capture your self-assessed difficulty rating each time you review a topic, or infer it purely from response latency/length?

2. **Chain-of-Focus Management**

   * Should the focus pointer auto-advance after each LLM interaction, or only when you explicitly mark a topic/task as “complete”?
   * How do you want to visualize “focus drift” over time? A simple timestamped log, or an embeddable chart in Neovim?

3. **Dagger.io Workflow**

   * Do you envision the plugin orchestrating Dagger entirely under the hood, or would you prefer a “run these commands in a shell” approach with documented recipes?

4. **Notes & Third-Party Imports**

   * Do you already have notes in a single directory that we can target for Markdown/Org importing?
   * If you later use other tools (e.g. Anki, Obsidian), would you want two-way sync, or is one-way ingestion enough?

5. **LLM Prompt Customization**

   * Would you like a UI for editing the system-prompt template, or should that live purely in your `learner.setup{…}` config?
   * For multi-segment prompts (analogies, summaries), how many segments should be the default batch size before you get prompted to refine it?

Let me know which of these suggestions resonate most, and feel free to expand or tweak—then we can dive deeper into the parts you’d like to prototype first!

## Setup

Call `require("learner").setup()` from your Neovim configuration. During
initialization the plugin connects to the storage backend specified under the
`storage` field of your setup options. The resulting storage handle is shared
with tasks and the spaced repetition scheduler so topics and tasks persist
across sessions.

## Events

The plugin ships with a lightweight dispatcher in `learner.events`. Modules and
external plugins can subscribe to events and react to core actions.

Two common events are:

- `topic_reviewed` – fired after a topic has been reviewed.
- `llm_response` – emitted when a response from the configured LLM is received.

To register a handler use `events.subscribe`:

```lua
local events = require("learner.events")

events.subscribe("topic_reviewed", function(info)
  print("topic " .. info.id .. " reviewed")
end)
```

Handlers are invoked in the order they were registered whenever
`events.emit()` is called. This allows third‑party extensions to hook into the
plugin without modifying its core modules.
