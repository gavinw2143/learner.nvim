# Observations on Tooling Discussion

The `README.md` outlines a conversation between Gavin and Langu about creating a Neovim plugin for managing learning tasks. Several tools are mentioned:

- **Neo4j** for graph storage
- **FSRS** for spaced repetition scheduling
- **OpenRouter** for LLM access
- **Dagger.io** containers for development
- **Telescope** for UI pickers

## Thoughts on the Chosen Tools

1. **Neo4j** is a strong choice for representing topics and their relations. If the project grows complex, it scales well. For simpler setups, a lightweight database like SQLite could be easier to maintain.
2. **FSRS** is well suited for spaced repetition. Alternatives like SM-2 (used in Anki) might be simpler to implement if advanced scheduling features are not required.
3. **OpenRouter** enables flexible LLM selection. Local models or providers with better latency/cost tradeoffs might be worth considering depending on usage volume.
4. **Dagger.io** is suggested for containerized development. Traditional Docker or Podman setups might be more familiar to contributors and provide similar benefits without additional learning overhead.
5. **Telescope** integrates nicely with Neovim, but other UI frameworks or custom Lua interfaces could also work if the project needs a different interaction model.

Overall the proposed stack seems reasonable, though exploring lighter-weight alternatives could reduce complexity for early prototypes.
